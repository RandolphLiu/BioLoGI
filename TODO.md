# Stage1: Understand The BioModel Selecton System (BMSS)

~~1. Download iBioSim and use it to simulate the generate models~~
~~2. Go over SBML tutorials~~
~~3. Go over SBOL turorials~~
~~4. Gather the equations for BMSS inducible systems~~
~~5. Understand the codes of BMSS inducible systems~~
~~6. Understand Differential Evolution Algorithm~~
~~7. Read the other two synBio papers~~
~~8. Draw the BMSS inducible promoter curves both in times and in concentrations~~
~~9. Implement MLE for parameter estimation~~
~~10. Test all optimization methods in scipy.optimize~~
~~11. Find more information about how to compute "relative activity" in SI~~
~~12. Implement the method on real data~~
~~13. Implement customized codes to run BMSS data~~
~~14. Calculate the Hill coefficient for 3OC6HSL-LuxR~~
~~15. Implement gradient-based optimization methods~~
~~16. Finish translation~~

# Stage2: omics analysis and beyond

~~1. Localize the scripts, change that into all-to-all manner.~~
~~2. What are informative figures?~~
~~3. Union of top genes of all tissues. This would ameliorate tissue bias~~
~~4. Heat map to show the distribution of top genes among tissues (high truncate)~~
~~5. summarize the enrichment table~~
~~6. case study of significant genes~~

# Stage3: single cell

~~1. examine the riken database~~
~~2. Select promising studies~~
~~3. download the papers and TPM of those (currently stick on GSE75748)~~
~~4. Impute the data~~
~~5. Make the coefficient algorithm more efficient~~
~~6. Test the outlier exclusion algorithm, and the correlation coefficient cutoff~~
~~7. Fitting filtered GSE75748 to logic gates (how to do this efficiently?)~~
~~8. Get a better name for BioLogic~~
~~9. Apply parameter constraints~~
~~10. Find out how to draw the "ring graph"~~
~~11. Find a good threshold for Delta AIC~~
~~12. Categorize the inducer/reporter genes~~
13. Draw example response curves
